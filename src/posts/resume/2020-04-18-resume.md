<p class="lead">Last week I came across <a href="https://ericwbailey.design/writing/how-to-not-make-a-resume-in-react.html">this post</a> by Eric Bailey. In it he describes some of the issues he's seeing with overengineered, inaccessible résumés.</p>

This again addresses the over-reliance on powerful Javascript frameworks like React, even in cases where simple semantic HTML might be better suited for the task.

I'm currently putting my self-isolated weekend time towards side projects, and I thought this could be something I can tackle. So I built something new:

## A résumé template

<figure class="extend">
    <a href="https://demo-resume.netlify.app"><img src="{{ 'resume.png' | media(page) }}" alt=""></a>
    <figcaption>A generated résumé on screen and in print</figcaption>
</figure>

This is a static micro-site generated by [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) that can be used as an online résumé. The output is basically just a simple `index.html` file.

__Features:__

* Fully Customizable
* Semantic HTML
* Accessible (WCAG AA) 
* Print Styles
* [h-resume](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-resume) Microformat
* Integrated Spellcheck Linter
* Self-Contained (no external resources)
* Search Engine Optimized (meta, JSON-LD)
* Critical CSS Inlined

You can find the full [source code on Github](https://github.com/maxboeck/resume), along with instructions how to set up and customize the project.

Many people are out of work due to the pandemic already, and even more might still lose their jobs as the world is headed towards a massive economic fallout. There is little we can do to stop that, but a tool like this might hopefully be a small help for people to find new work once the situation improves.

Stay healthy!
