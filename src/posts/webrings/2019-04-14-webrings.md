<p class="lead">After Tatiana Mac proposed to <a href="https://twitter.com/TatianaTMac/status/1114388079630929926">bring webrings back</a>, I hacked something new together over the weekend: A starter kit for hosting your own webring!</p>

## What's a Webring?

It's a blast from the past: In the 90s, sites about a common topic could join together in a central index. To be a member, you had to embed a little widget on your page that contained a "forward", a "backward", and a "random" button. These buttons would then link to the next or previous site in the ring.

__UPDATE:__ *Since the term "webring" is trademarked in the US, this needs another cool name. Know any? Please [add it to this thread](https://github.com/maxboeck/webring/issues/1)!*

## A curated community

To keep the ring from getting spammed or flooded with trolls, it has to be curated. The project does that by hosting the member index on Github, in a simple [JSON file](https://github.com/maxboeck/webring/blob/master/src/data/members.json). Admins can accept or decline pull requests from people who want to join the ring, after reviewing their sites. There's also a Code of Conduct that every member has to follow in order to be part of the ring. 

For people who are not technical enough to submit a pull request, there's also a simple signup form (using Netlify forms) to send the admin your site's info via email and let them add you.

## Free and Open

I wanted to make this as easy as possible, so people can start linking their personal sites together straight away. So I made the boilerplate using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/). After forking [the codebase](https://github.com/maxboeck/webring), the proud webring admin only needs to set a title and a bit of meta data.

Eleventy then generates a [site like this](https://webringdemo.netlify.com) that lists all the members, shows the Code of Conduct and the instructions on how to join.

You can deploy it to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a free static site host, with just a few clicks. Netlify also lets you either use one of their subdomains, or a custom one you own.

## A central widget

Members of the ring can copy a code snippet to embed a banner on their site. I borrowed a bit from Twitters embed widget here: The basic markup is just a link to the index, and the prev/random/next links. But if you also include the script tag, it will replace that with a custom web component, designed by the ring admin.

```html
<webring-banner>
    <p>Member of the <a href="https://webringdemo.netlify.com">An Example Webring</a> webring</p>
    <a href="https://webringdemo.netlify.com/prev">Previous</a>
    <a href="https://webringdemo.netlify.com/random">Random</a>
    <a href="https://webringdemo.netlify.com/next">Next</a>
</webring-banner>
<script async src="https://webringdemo.netlify.com/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

This will automatically show the title, member count, maybe a logo. And it can be edited from a central location. It might look something like this:

<webring-banner>
    <p>Member of the <a href="https://webringdemo.netlify.com">An Example Webring</a> webring</p>
    <a href="https://webringdemo.netlify.com/prev">Previous</a>
    <a href="https://webringdemo.netlify.com/random">Random</a>
    <a href="https://webringdemo.netlify.com/next">Next</a>
</webring-banner>
<script async src="https://webringdemo.netlify.com/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## RSS Feeds

If a member publishes an RSS feed on their site, they can add that to the ring as well: the index page will generate an [OPML file](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_Processor_Markup_Language), so people can subscribe to all members at once.

## Host your own Ring!

If you want to start your own webring, go ahead! Fork the [repository on Github](https://github.com/maxboeck/webring) and follow the instructions there - It's free and doesn't take long!
