<p class="lead">The web needs to take itself less seriously. It's barely out of its twenties and suddenly it's all like "I can't make fansites for hippos anymore, I have businesses to run".</p>

<p>It used to be cooler. It used to be <span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: 2px;">weirder</span>.</p>

As Sarah Drasner puts it in ["In Defense of a Fussy Website"](https://css-tricks.com/in-defense-of-a-fussy-website/):

<blockquote>
    <p>While we’re all laser-focused on shipping the newest feature with the hottest software and the best Lighthouse scores, I’ve been missing a bit of the joy on the web.
    Apps are currently conveying little care for UX, guidance, richness, and — well, for humans trying to communicate through a computer, we’re certainly bending a lot to… the computer.</p>
</blockquote>

I really liked that post, so I made small website meant to showcase how a more personal web could look like, and hopefully give someone else inspiration to make their own corner of the web a bit weirder.

## More whimsy, please!

Introducing: [The Whimsical Web](https://whimsical.club) - a curated list of sites with an extra bit of fun.

I've collected a few of my favorites to start, but anyone can add a site to the list if it's fun, quirky and personal.
Just [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/maxboeck/whimsical/issues/new?template=add-this-website.md&title=Add+this+Website%21) and let me know.

Let's see some fussy websites!
